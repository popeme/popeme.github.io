    "text": "I am a dual PhD Student in Neuroscience and Complex Networks and Systems in the NRT Program at Indiana University. Broadly, I am interested in how the structure of complex systems (like the brain) constrains their dynamics, and how we might characterize a system’s dynamics in terms of its information content, with a particular focus on higher-order, synergistic interactions. I have been researching some of these questions for the last four years in the lab of Olaf Sporns.\nFeel free to take a look at the Publications tab if you’re interested in what we’ve been working on, or drop me an email!"
